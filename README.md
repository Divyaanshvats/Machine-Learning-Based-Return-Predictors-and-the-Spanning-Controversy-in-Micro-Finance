# Machine-Learning-Based-Return-Predictors-and-the-Spanning-Controversy-in-Micro-Finance
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of loan data, covering preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. Python served as the primary tool for data manipulation, visualization, and implementing machine learning models, leveraging libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
Among the tested Machine Learning models, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy. XGBoost followed closely as the second-best performer. The results highlight their effectiveness in this specific dataset.
